Free Falling Visual (easier to view on google docs : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTgQp7T0vNb5fHXmdUBrgGg0M1Sx0XFMrSUCBCu7A54/edit?usp=sharing )

	I have always wanted to try and make some interesting visual patterns with my code but have never taken the time to try it. I wanted to attempt to make some sort of “trippy” visual project for this final but a lot of the effects that I had researched looked more texture based than object based. I looked at a couple of idea videos from 3ds projects and games and I stumbled upon this video “https://youtu.be/y2IAjXl5xRU?t=100” and at the time stamp I saw a very studying visual. That visual is what I want the base of my project to be. I want to create this free falling visual with a bit more flare, this could even be used as the background for my portfolio website. 


Project break up: 
	
First steps
Create the shapes I would use for the project 
Basic shapes 
Spheres 
Long cubes 
Triangles 
All having set or completely random colors 

More complex shapes 
Devil fruit inspired shapes 
3d models of them might exist
Random objects that have a similar feel
Real fruits 



Next steps 
Creating the procedure in which the shapes and models are displayed 
General idea is that there is a set radius of space where things cannot spawn and from that space the objects and basic shapes will be generated
The camera will move through this negative space into the void
Shapes should be deleted when they pas a certain point and the spawn distance should be keep low to not have the program lag 
This will be the hardest part of the project and take the majority of time
Final steps 
Clean up
Check code for errors 
Add extra shapes or objects 
Correct or add missing comments
